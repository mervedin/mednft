# MedNFT Project

## Overview
The MedNFT project aims to address the critical challenge of data scarcity in artificial intelligence, especially within the healthcare sector. As AI systems require vast amounts of high-quality data to function effectively, obtaining this data has proven difficult in many areas, particularly in health-related fields. MedNFT provides a secure platform that allows individuals to sell their health data as NFTs, ensuring their anonymity and privacy throughout the process. By leveraging blockchain technology, MedNFT empowers individuals to take control of their health information, creating value for both data providers and researchers while contributing to the development of AI solutions in healthcare.

## Steps for Development


### 1. **Define Data Structure**
   - Create data structures to hold health data metadata, including:
     - Hash of the radiology image
     - Anonymized report data
     - Wallet address for payment
     - Validator approval status

### 2. **Implement Validation Mechanism**
   - Create a function for validating uploaded data:
     - Check metadata for authenticity
     - Remove personal information
     - Seek approval from validators

### 3. **Integrate NFT Minting**
   - Use Metaplex or another library to mint NFTs:
     - Link the validated health data to the NFT
     - Ensure that the NFT only reveals the image after purchase

### 4. **Create Frontend Interface**
   - Develop a web interface where users can:
     - Upload their health data
     - Specify their wallet address
     - View available NFTs and their details
   - Use React or another framework for the frontend.

### 5. **Implement AI Integration**
   - Integrate AI to generate summaries for the uploaded reports:
     - Use a machine learning model to provide insights based on the data.

### 6. **Testing**
   - Thoroughly test the smart contract:
     - Simulate data uploads and NFT minting
     - Validate security measures against data theft

### 7. **Deploy the Application**
   - Deploy the smart contract on the Solana Devnet or Testnet:
     ```bash
     solana program deploy path/to/your/compiled/program.so
     ```

### 8. **Monitor and Maintain**
   - Monitor transactions and user interactions on the platform.
   - Update the smart contract and frontend as necessary based on user feedback and technological improvements.

## Conclusion
MedNFT aims to create a secure marketplace for health data while preserving user anonymity. By leveraging blockchain technology and AI, we can ensure the authenticity and value of health data.
